Scenario: 1. Required is empty. AdditionalInformation is valid
    Given plug-ins is a string of null
    And additional-information is a string of 30 characters
    When a PUT request is made to update solution Sln1 plug-ins section
    Then a response status of 400 is returned
    And the plug-ins required field contains plugins-required

@2793
Scenario: 2. Required has a value. AdditionalInformation length is greater than 500 characters
    Given plug-ins is a string of yes
    And additional-information is a string of 501 characters
    When a PUT request is made to update solution Sln1 plug-ins section
    Then a response status of 400 is returned
    And the plug-ins maxLength field contains plugins-detail
